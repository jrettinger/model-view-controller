# Name
Jason's Model-View-Controller (MVC) Challenge: Tech Blog

## Description
 I attempted to create a CMS-style blog site similar to a Wordpress site, where developers can publish their blog posts and comment on other developersâ€™ posts as well. Unfortunately, I was not able to fully complete this module. I was able to bring the blog to local host but when I went to create a login the server crashed. I uploaded to Heroku; however, the same error occurs.
